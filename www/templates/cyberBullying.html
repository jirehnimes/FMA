				Bea is a 15-year old high school student who had been bullied online.  One of her classmates posted online, “OMG! It’s confirmed! Yuck! She was included in Top 10 because she is the girlfriend of our teacher! #youknowwhoyouare #suchab**ch!” Just few seconds, some of her classmates started to comment also. She was at loss for words when she read it. She wanted to convince her classmates that this was not true. One of the Facebook statements was allegedly accusing her that having an affair with her teacher. The post gained five likes and 98 comments.  The victim ranked 9th in their class during the 2nd Grading period of the last school year. The victim said that the Facebook statement was malicious. Some comments turned out to be offensive and of the comments even read like she’s really having an illicit affair with their teacher..

				She rather keeps her mouth shut even though the posted status was malicious and not true. She chose not to report the incident to her class adviser because it would just create another trouble between them.  She doesn’t want to say anything out of fear or retaliation. She feels hopeless and stuck like she cant get out of the situation; feels like no one to help her; feels more depressed & rejected by her friends and other groups of people; feels unsafe and afraid; feels ashamed, confused and stressed out wondering why this is happening to her. She  decided to deactivate all her social networking sites which include Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so she could not read their hurtful words against her – End of game

				The victim realized that stopping school is not the solution to end all the allegations hurled against her. She hope and pray and that they would stop harassing her.

				The school where the victim is enrolled is now working with psychologists and working on revamping the bullying section in the handbook to put a better system in place to fight bullying. The victim is an image of a strong teenager who survived cyberbullying and was able to manage to cope with cyberbullying and her parents guided her and instilled in her the love she rightfully needed. 
				CASE SOLVED!
