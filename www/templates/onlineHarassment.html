				My former boyfriend had some photos of me and him of a private nature however even before we broke up, they were already deleted and also my ex’s mobile phone got stolen in March 2014.  
				The incident happened sometime in May 2014 when the victim received an update through her email that she used her Twitter account but it was implausible on her part because she doesn’t tweet frequently and only use Twitter as source of information. Out of curiosity, she opened her Twitter account and found that someone hacked and changed its content as well as the displayed photos. The unknown suspect used her account to tweet malevolent content using a malicious hashtag #sluttygirlproblems. The victim was able to sign back into her Twitter account and managed to delete the photos uploaded by the hacker. She even informed those people that her Twitter account was compromised by someone. 
				Another incident was when her sibling told her that someone saw her photo wearing a bikini on the Reddit website. She was surprised and got upset. She called up her former boyfriend and allegedly accused for using and manipulating her photos. Her reputation as a woman was clearly destroyed because her photos were published online without her consent or approval. She emailed the website administrator to take down her photos and delete all possible links to stop the circulation. Within a few days, her photo wearing a bikini was taken down. Unfortunately, the online harassment was repeated. A friend contacted her informing the same scenario. With disappointment, she just decided to say that the photo was edited and not her. 
				The last incident happened when she received an email from someone with abusive comments saying that “I know what you want you slut!” and also two photos of male organ. When she asked about the sender’s identity, the reply was “Someone who would give what you deserve!” and then also sent one photo of me in a private nature and threatened that if she did not reply, he would spread in in the internet. The victim did not reply afterwards.
				The victim got paranoid that her photos would surface in the internet. She decided to look for the source of these emails. She made use of the available email trace headers and found the IP address and reported it. However, the IP address was from California, US so she wasn’t sure if the email really came from there or if the hacker made it so. The victim also found a site that would show a list of people. She used Pipl to look for the used email account – myfullname@gmail.com and was linked to a picasawebgoogle.com site where apparently she made a Google+ account with the picture of her in a bikini as profile picture. I was added to a person’s circle and that person named “Rey Pinyoko” (Rape Me), which she definitely think it’s not a funny joke. She clicked her own photo and read all abusive and malicious comments against her. The victim have been very emotionally disturbed by these incidents and doesn’t know who are responsible for these.

				Scene... Irene feels depressed. She doesn’t want to go outside because of shame. 
				If you keep it to yourself, the tarpaulin will still be there. Your reputation will be put in harm.
